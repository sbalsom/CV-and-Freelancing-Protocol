# CV-and-Freelancing-Protocol
How I Work With My Freelance Clients :

1. We discuss the project
I chat with you by email, on twitter, on skype, on slack... wherever you prefer to have this initial conversation. 
We discuss :
- the details of your project
- the desired timeframe
- rate (generally 30â‚¬/hr)
- the terms of the contract

2. I draw up a contract and an initial invoice with an estimation of hours. 
We discuss again to make sure we both agree on the terms and price. 

3. Continuous communication
I give you weekly/monthly updates on how the project is going, show you prototypes or mid-way 
points of the project in development.

4. Deployment 
A domain name of your choice (depending on availability) is purchased. 
Your website or app is deployed on this domain. 
You have the option to maintain access to the source code for future website maintenance.

5. Billing
I send you the invoice and the money is transferred (within one month maximum) to the specified bank account.
