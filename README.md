# CV-and-Freelancing-Protocol

## How I Work With My Freelance Clients :

I am a junior fullstack developer, offering my services as a package for startups who need technical support launching their products. I offer my services at 125â‚¬/day, or my client and I can decide on a fixed rate for a larger project.

## Backend :

I am trained in Ruby on Rails and have experience working with PostGreSQL and Heroku to deploy apps, build RESTful APIs and handle user authentication and authorization using Devise and Pundit. I've also worked with Sinatra for smaller apps.

I have similar experience developing apps using Python/Flask.

I can render JSON from the backend or fetch and parse JSON from external interfaces (APIs). I use Nokogiri to scrape the web for open-source data.

I am versed in SQL and database queries using ActiveRecord, handling params and building forms, relational databases and model associations, MVC software architecture patterns.

I value Test Driven Development and use Rspec and Capybara to develop a testing suite for your rails application, making sure that your app functions the way you expect it to in all cases. I also work with Rubocop and other linters to make sure the code I wrote and deliver is high-quality and eloquent.

## Frontend :

I am trained in Javascript (ES6) and have experience working with Vue.js/Vuex and React to render data from the backend to the frontend, using state to render data quickly and efficiently to the user.

I am experienced with CSS and SCSS conventions such as BEM, CSS variables and keyframes, media queries and webkit extensions that allow design to be flexible and supported on all browsers.

For static webpages I use Middleman, a lightweight framework designed to work with Ruby to deliver simple websites (often the case for a promotional webpage that holds no data).

Throughout my workflow I use Trello for project management, Git for version control, and document my progress for my client, using powerpoints to demonstrate the current state of the project and all future steps until deployment.

## How I work with you

### 1. We discuss the project
I chat with you by email, on twitter, on skype, on slack... wherever you prefer to have this initial conversation. 
We discuss :
- the details of your project
- the desired timeframe
- rate
- the terms of the contract

### 2. I draw up a contract and an initial invoice with an estimation of hours. 
We discuss again to make sure we both agree on the terms and price. 

### 3. Continuous communication
I give you weekly/monthly updates on how the project is going, show you prototypes or mid-way 
points of the project in development.

### 4. Deployment 
If needed, a domain name of your choice (depending on availability) is purchased. 

Your website or app is deployed on this domain. 

You have the option to maintain access to the source code for future website maintenance.

### 5. Billing
I send you the invoice and the agreed upon remuneration is transferred (within one month) to my bank account.
